# Over Paste
Paste your every idea

## Introduction
Over Paste is a simple project developed for the "Tecnologie e Linguaggi per il Web" course of "[Sicurezza dei Sistemi e delle Reti Informatiche](http://www.cosp.unimi.it/offerta_didattica/F68.htm)".
Over Paste was born following the successful model of [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com), a website used to share portions of source code.
The application was developed with the technologies illustrated during the course: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/) for the server application, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript for the client.
